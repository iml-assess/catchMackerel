Analyses of mackerel catch.

The following structure is used;

1. Data: involves reading in all relevant data (ziff, nafo, commercial length-frequencies and sub-sample for biological analysis).
2. Landings: overview of landing data (+comparison of totals with previous resdocs for verification).
3. CAA: catch-at-age calculations for total landings and by region (+comparison with previous resdocs for verification),
4. CAL: catch-at-length calculations for total landings and by factor influencing this to try and assess population level changes.

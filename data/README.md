# bio

## lf 
Random length-frequency samples from port-sampling.

## bio
Mostly stratified subsamples of the above.

Can also include:
-  Samples from surveys, etc.
-  Random commercial samples (lf), not subsampled.

NOTES:
The distinction between random vs stratified samples is essential for catch-at-age/length-frequency calculations. There appear to be no consistent indication of this in the database, even under remarks that are generally not extracted. 

Orally transmitted information:
-  F.G.: bio samples from NL between 1983-1994 were taken randomly and not length-stratified. It appears samples were taken when and if convenient for the samplers.
-  F.G.: 4X and 4Vn have few samples after 1983, when mackerel management was transferred from the maritimes to Quebec.
-  A.S.: in 2020 bio samples from NL were random (simplified process because of covid).
